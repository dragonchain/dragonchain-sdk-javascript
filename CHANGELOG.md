# Changelog

## 4.0.0

Because Dragonchain has a breaking change to replace its indexing solution, this is also a breaking SDK change for queries and custom indexing.

The following are worth noting when transitioning from 3.X.X to 4.X.X:

- Custom indexes have changed for a new redisearch schema. Transaction types
  can no longer be updated, and custom indexes must be provided upfront when
  creating a transaction type or smart contract. If updating is desired,
  simply delete and recreate the relevant transaction type/smart contract
  with the new desired custom indexes.
- A transaction type's indexes are now removed when the transaction type is
  deleted. You can no longer query for transactions from a deleted transaction
  type (or smart contract). (The transactions still exist and can be retrieved
  directly by transaction id, they simply can't be searched with a query)
- Querying blocks and transactions are completely different, and now use
  [Redisearch queries](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisearch/Query_Syntax.html).
  Check their client functions for argument reference. Note the response schema
  of queries remain unchanged.
- Smart contract querying has been removed, and instead replaced with a generic
  `list_smart_contracts` which simply returns all contracts.

Check [the docs](https://node-sdk-docs.dragonchain.com/latest/) for more details on migrating from v3 to v4.
